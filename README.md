# The project 
The project is far from finished and may change drasticlly from this current iteration ...
## The user credentials database
I assumed that the database would be stored locally on the hosting machine of the application , i wouldnt expect the app to me be used by millions of people or anything , the goal for it is to be local. 
I use the $maridb$ database instead of $mysql$ , i know how availble that would be on other plateforms, if anything i could contain the code base and be done.


# Dependencies 
* A c++ compiler , i use g++ in the build process.
* Qt , on UNIX you can install it using your package manager (windows support soon).
* maridb (only if you are hosting the program).
* maridb cpp connector.

# Disclamer 
This program is not yet ready and i will very much love to her your input , any bugs or memory leaks please do point them out!
